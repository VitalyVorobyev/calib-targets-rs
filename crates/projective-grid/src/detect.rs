//! Detection task facade.
//!
//! The working implementations target the square lattice with any of the three
//! input-feature kinds. [`Evidence::Oriented2`] is the native shape: a
//! seed-and-grow pipeline (seed → BFS grow → validate → fit) or an axis-driven
//! topological grid finder, selected via [`SquareAlgorithm`].
//! [`Evidence::Positions`] (orientation-free) and [`Evidence::Oriented1`]
//! (single-axis) are synthesized up to the Oriented2 shape
//! ([`crate::orient`]) and then run the same strategies — so all three
//! square input kinds share one back-half. All produce the same
//! [`GridSolution`] shape.
//!
//! The remaining combinations — [`Evidence::Oriented3`],
//! [`Evidence::CoordinateHypotheses`], and every `(Hex, *)` variant — are
//! typed [`GridError::UnsupportedCombination`] placeholders (see the support
//! matrix on [`detect_grid`]).
//!
//! The detection surface is pinned to `f32`. The generic-`F` surface that
//! remains in the crate is the pure-geometry [`crate::geometry`] module.
