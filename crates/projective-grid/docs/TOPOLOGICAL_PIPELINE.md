# Topological grid pipeline — atomic stages

Concise stage-by-stage map of `projective_grid::topological::build_grid_topological`,
an opt-in alternative to chessboard-v2's seed-and-grow grid builder.
Based on Shu / Brunton / Fiala 2009: Delaunay triangulation → edge
classification (Grid / Diagonal / Spurious) → triangle pair-merge into
quads → topological + geometric quad filters → BFS labelling on the
quad mesh.

The chessboard-v2 pipeline (separately documented in
`crates/calib-targets-chessboard/docs/PIPELINE.md`) wraps this builder
when `DetectorParams::graph_build_algorithm = Topological`. ChArUco
unconditionally pins `ChessboardV2` instead — the per-cell axis test
in Stage 2 below cannot survive marker-internal X-corners.

## Stage table

| # | Name | In | Out | Decision | Failure modes | Knobs |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0a | axis-validity pre-filter | per-corner `axes: [AxisHint; 2]` | `usable_mask` over corners | drop corners where **both** `axes[k].sigma ≥ max_axis_sigma_rad`. Sigma `= π` is the no-info sentinel from `chess-corners`. | high angular noise globally → too few usable corners; opposite failure: too tight → loses real corners that happen to have one wide axis | `max_axis_sigma_rad` (default `0.6 rad ≈ 34°`) |
| 0b | global-axis cluster gate (optional) | usable corners + caller-supplied `AxisClusterCenters` | `usable_mask` further restricted | when `axis_cluster_centers.is_some()`, drop corners none of whose axes is within `cluster_axis_tol_rad` of either center. The chessboard adapter computes centers via its own `cluster_axes` (histogram + double-angle 2-means) and passes them in; standalone callers can pass `None` and skip the gate | centers chosen on a degenerate population (e.g. 1-direction histogram) bias the gate; tightening below 16° regresses heavily-distorted Gemini boards | `axis_cluster_centers` (default `None`), `cluster_axis_tol_rad` (default `16° = 0.279`) |
| 1 | Delaunay triangulation | usable subset of `&[Point2]` | `Triangulation { triangles, halfedges }` over **global** indices | `delaunator` crate; we triangulate the packed usable subset and remap triangle vertex indices back to the original `positions` index space (`triangulate_usable`) so downstream stages keep using global indices | < 3 usable corners; degenerate point clouds | — |
| 2 | edge classification | triangles + positions + axes | per-half-edge `EdgeKind ∈ {Grid, Diagonal, Spurious}` | First pass: at each endpoint compute edge angle `θ = atan2(b − a)`; find min undirected (mod π) distance to that endpoint's usable axes; classify the half-edge as **Grid** only if both endpoints pass `d < axis_align_tol_rad`, otherwise **Spurious**. Second pass: for each Delaunay triangle with exactly two Grid edges, if those two edges meet at one vertex using different local axis slots, promote the remaining edge to **Diagonal**. This is local-affine: projected cell diagonals come from the two projected grid-step vectors, not from a fixed 45° image angle. Diagonal inference has no separate angle threshold. | axis uncertainty blurs grid-edge recognition; all-grid triangles stay diagnostic and are not promoted | `axis_align_tol_rad` (default `15°`) |
| 3 | triangle composition | edge kinds | per-triangle bucket: `mergeable` (1 D, 2 G) / `all_grid` (3 G) / `multi_diag` (≥ 2 D) / `has_spurious` | counts per triangle; `mergeable` are merge-eligible; the other buckets are diagnostic only (failure-mode telemetry) | very severe foreshortening can still produce `all_grid` triangles when the diagonal itself passes the grid-edge gate; dense clutter → `multi_diag` | — |
| 4 | triangle-pair merge → quads | mergeable triangles + half-edges | `Vec<Quad>` (4 vertices in CW order) | for each `mergeable` triangle, look up the buddy of its unique Diagonal half-edge; if buddy's triangle is also `mergeable` with the same Diagonal, fuse — quad's four perimeter edges are all Grid | triangles without a unique Diagonal (boundary or ambiguous); known regression: triangles whose two long edges classify as Diagonal (severe perspective + radial distortion, see overview Gap 8) | — |
| 5 | topological filter | quads + per-corner incidence | quads with `< 2` illegal corners | per-corner incidence count over quad-perimeter edges; corner is illegal if its incidence count > 8 (degree > 4 in the quad mesh, impossible in a regular grid) | dense corners at boundaries / occlusions inflate incidence | — |
| 6a | parallelogram filter | filtered quads + positions | quads passing `max(l_01/l_23, l_12/l_30) ≤ edge_ratio_max` | opposing edges of each quad must not differ by more than `edge_ratio_max`; rejects extreme parallelograms | severe perspective leaves legitimate quads with high opposing-edge ratio (loosen knob) | `edge_ratio_max` (default `10.0`) |
| 6b | per-component cell-size filter | survivors of 6a + positions | quads whose perimeter edges fall inside `[quad_edge_min_rel, quad_edge_max_rel] × component_median` | compute connected quad-mesh components on the post-parallelogram set; per-component median quad-edge length; reject quads with any edge outside the band. Catches double-cell hops (oversized quads at component edges) that the parallelogram test admits when both opposing pairs scale together. The lower bound is disabled by default (rejects too many small but legitimate quads on heavily-distorted boards) | tight `quad_edge_max_rel` rejects perspective-stretched quads on Gemini-style boards; loose `quad_edge_max_rel` re-admits the cross-cell hops | `quad_edge_min_rel` (default `0.0`, disabled), `quad_edge_max_rel` (default `1.8`) |
| 7 | topological walking | filtered quads + positions | `Vec<TopologicalComponent>` with labelled `(i, j)` per corner | BFS on quad-adjacency graph (shared edges); seed quad gets `(0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (0,1)` CW; labels propagate through shared-edge cell-step rules; rebase each component to `(0, 0)` | disconnected components left independent (handled by `crate::component_merge`); rare label conflicts at boundary if filters too loose | — |
| 8 | output + diagnostics | labelled components | `TopologicalGrid { components, diagnostics: TopologicalStats }` | per-component bbox rebase; emit per-stage counters | — | — |

## Component merge

After this builder finishes, `projective_grid::component_merge::merge_components_local`
runs as a shared post-stage (the same one chessboard-v2 uses) — image-
free, local-geometry-only, distortion-tolerant. See the
`projective_grid::component_merge` module docs for the merge predicate.

Documented gap (see `docs/projective_grid_overview.md`): merge requires
overlapping `(i, j)` labels after a candidate alignment; spatially-
disjoint components separated by a missing row never reach the overlap
test and stay split.

## Diagnostics (`TopologicalStats`)

```text
corners_in, corners_used,
triangles,
grid_edges, diagonal_edges, spurious_edges,
triangles_mergeable, triangles_all_grid,
triangles_multi_diag, triangles_has_spurious,
quads_merged, quads_kept,
components,
```

Plus per-quadrant labelled / unlabelled counts and unlabelled-corner
axis sigmas printed by `bench diagnose --algorithm topological` —
canonical starting point for triangle-merge / classification gap
investigations.

## Known limitations vs chessboard-v2

- **ChArUco-style targets** (markers inside white squares) — corners
  detected inside marker bits have axes that lock to the marker's
  local orientation, not the chessboard grid. The Stage 2 axis test
  classifies their incident edges as Spurious or Diagonal, breaking
  triangle merging across the marker. Use chessboard-v2 instead;
  CharucoDetector pins this.
- **Heavy perspective + radial distortion** — the local-affine triangle
  inference removes the old fixed-45° diagonal failure. Remaining hard cases
  are mostly `all_grid` triangles, where the projected diagonal itself falls
  inside the grid-axis tolerance, and component gaps caused by real occlusion
  or missing corners. Candidate follow-ups: parity-assisted classification or
  hybrid extension via chessboard-v2's local-H Stage 6.
