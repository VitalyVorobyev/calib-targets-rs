# Architecture knowledge base

A cross-cutting map of the **detection stack** — every atomic algorithm, how the
algorithms compose into each detector's pipeline, how the crates layer, and an
honest critique of the redundancy/debt with a ranked cleanup backlog.

This complements the existing docs: [`../algorithms/`](../algorithms/) holds
per-algorithm *deep-dives*; this tree holds the *atlas + wiring + critique* that ties
them together. Scope is the algorithm-implementing crates (L0–L3):
`projective-grid`, `calib-targets-core`, `-aruco`, `-chessboard`, `-charuco`,
`-puzzleboard`, `-marker`.

## The one-screen answer

If you only read one paragraph: the stack is **not overengineered at the crate
level** — the dependency graph is a clean DAG, the four detectors share one grid
spine by *embedding* `chessboard` (not by copy-paste), and the decode layers
(`aruco`, `puzzle`, `marker`) are cohesive and duplication-free. What makes it *feel*
tangled is **debt, not design**: a homography solver forked verbatim between `core`
and `projective-grid`, a half-finished `GridCoords → Coord` coordinate migration
frozen behind `*_to_next` shims, a few same-named-but-different modules (`recovery`
×2, "validation" ×2), and one dead single-variant enum. The big crate
(`projective-grid`, 3× the next) is big mostly on purpose — it is a **published
standalone library** whose hex / dot-grid / orientation-free breadth is intended
product that no in-workspace detector uses. Would I rebuild it this way? The
structure, ~80% yes; the within-crate debris, no — and it is a *consolidation* job,
not a rewrite. Full reasoning in [`critique.md`](critique.md).

## Map

| Doc | What it answers |
|---|---|
| [`algorithm-atlas.md`](algorithm-atlas.md) | **What** — every atomic algorithm (home, signature, one-liner, used-by) + the algorithm×pipeline matrix. |
| [`pipeline-maps.md`](pipeline-maps.md) | **How they compose** — each detector stage-by-stage; which algorithm runs, local vs delegated. |
| [`dependency-and-layering.md`](dependency-and-layering.md) | **Who depends on whom** — the crate DAG, the layering, why the big crate is big, the library-only surface. |
| [`critique.md`](critique.md) | **Is it any good** — what's solid, the findings (with `file:line` evidence + severity), and the from-scratch verdict. |
| [`chore-backlog.md`](chore-backlog.md) | **What to do** — ranked, effort/risk/API-tagged consolidation items (C-1 … C-9). |

**Suggested reading order for onboarding:** this page → `pipeline-maps.md` (trace one
detector end-to-end) → `algorithm-atlas.md` (look up any stage's algorithm) →
`critique.md` → `chore-backlog.md`.

## <a id="keeping-this-current"></a>Keeping this current

This is a **hand-maintained snapshot**, not generated. It drifts the moment the code
moves, so it carries a lightweight refresh rule (wired into
[`../development/release-gates.md`](../development/release-gates.md)):

> **When a PR adds, removes, renames, or relocates an atomic algorithm, or changes a
> detector's pipeline stages, update [`algorithm-atlas.md`](algorithm-atlas.md) and
> [`pipeline-maps.md`](pipeline-maps.md) in the same PR.** When it changes a crate's
> internal dependencies or public tiers, update
> [`dependency-and-layering.md`](dependency-and-layering.md).

Practical guidance:

- **Anchors are `file.rs::fn`, not line numbers** — function names survive edits, so a
  rename is the only thing that breaks a link. Line numbers in prose are pinned
  reference points, not load-bearing.
- **The status column is the perishable part.** When a `📚` library-only path gains a
  workspace-detector caller (e.g. a new dot-grid detector), flip it to `✅` in the
  atlas and add its row to the matrix.
- **When you close a backlog item**, strike it in [`chore-backlog.md`](chore-backlog.md)
  and update the `critique.md` finding it resolves (don't silently delete — the trail
  is the observability).
- **Spot-check before release:** resolve ~10 atlas `file.rs::fn` anchors and confirm
  the matrix still matches reality (no `✅` row with no production caller). This is the
  cheap version of the [evidence-driven](../development/debugging.md) discipline
  applied to docs.

These docs follow the same rules as the rest of the tree: no private-dataset
specifics ([policy](../development/private-dataset-policy.md)), and split any file past
~800–1000 lines.
