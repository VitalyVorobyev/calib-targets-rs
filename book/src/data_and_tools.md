# Data and Tools

This repository includes data and scripts that support testing and debugging.

## Data folders

- `testdata/`: sample images and JSON configs used by examples and tests.
- `synthetic/`: synthetic board assets and configs.
- `tmpdata/`: default output folder for example-generated images and reports.

## Tools

The `tools/` folder contains helper scripts for visualization and synthetic data generation, for example:

- Overlay plotting for chessboard, marker, and ChArUco outputs.
- Synthetic marker target generation.
- Dictionary utilities.

These tools are optional but useful when debugging or extending detectors.
